# WD20P Library

![WD20PLibrary](https://i.ibb.co/0FtcLrm/WD20-P-Library.png)

WD20P online library is a react application inspired by one of our earlier static website projects in the bootcamp where we made hard-coded book library using HTML and CSS. It is based on Kadir Media's [YouTube Tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU2c_02YaME)

## What are the features of WD20P Online Library

When you open the application, you will be directed to the homepage where 40 books from an example-data API are displayed. You have the option to add or remove books from your favorites by clicking a button that will display dynamic text based on whether the book is already in your favorites or not. Navigation to both the favorites page and the book details page is enabled through the use of react-router-dom v6.

## What went well

Being one of the first react tutorial that I coded along, this video helped me understand react concepts better. It also utilizes context API to manage the states of the favorite books.

## What are the challenges encountered

Since this tutorial was on my early stages as a react developer, I was a little bit confused with the concepts especially where contextAPI is concerned.

## Codebase differences

Being fairly new in React at the time there are very little codebase differences compared to the actual tutorial albeit some minor styling adjustments.

## Future improvements

A fairly simple project that served its purpose to make me understand react concepts, there will be no future improvement in this app.
